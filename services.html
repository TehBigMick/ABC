      <h1>Trusted Publishing Professionals</h1>
      <p>Sometimes you need a human touch. Below are categories of professionals who can help bring your book to the next level. These are trusted people with experience in the publishing industry, from editing to cover art.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Editors (Developmental, Copy, &amp; Proofreading)</h2>
      <p>A professional editor can vastly improve your manuscript. Developmental editors help with big-picture story and structure, copy editors refine your language, and proofreaders catch final typos. A good editor ensures your book is the best it can be.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Browse freelance editor profiles on <a href="https://reedsy.com">Reedsy</a> (a marketplace connecting authors with top freelancers:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}) or the Editorial Freelancers Association directory. You can also ask for recommendations in our community forum.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Beta Readers &amp; Critique Partners</h2>
      <p>Beta readers are early test readers who give feedback from a typical reader's perspective. Critique partners (often fellow writers) provide more in-depth feedback on writing craft. They can highlight confusing plot points, characters that need development, or pacing issues before you publish.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Join our <a href="forum.html">Community Forum</a> to connect with fellow authors for beta reading exchanges or critique partnerships. Writing groups (both online and local) are also great places to find beta readers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cover Designers &amp; Illustrators</h2>
      <p>A professional cover artist knows how to create an eye-catching cover that suits your genre. If you're not design-savvy, hiring a cover designer is a smart investment to attract readers – a polished cover gives a strong first impression.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Check out portfolios on Reedsy or hire artists via platforms like <a href="https://99designs.com">99designs</a> or <a href="https://www.fiverr.com">Fiverr</a>. We also plan to showcase recommended cover designers in our directory (stay tuned!).</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Formatters</h2>
      <p>Formatting professionals prepare your book's interior layout for print or e-book. They ensure consistency in fonts, margins, headings, etc., so that your manuscript looks professional in EPUB/PDF formats.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Some editors or cover designers also offer formatting. You can find dedicated formatters on freelance marketplaces or get referrals from other authors in our forum.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Marketing &amp; PR Experts</h2>
      <p>Marketing consultants or publicists can help plan your book launch and ongoing promotions. They might manage ad campaigns, seek book reviews, or arrange blog tours and author events.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Look for marketing experts on Reedsy (they have vetted publicists and marketers), or connect with experienced book marketers via author networks and forums. Personal recommendations from other authors can be invaluable here.</p>
