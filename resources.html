      <h2>1. Writing Your Manuscript</h2>
      <p>Every great book starts with a manuscript. Whether you prefer a classic word processor or specialized novel-writing software, it's important to find a tool that fits your writing style. Many authors swear by <strong>Scrivener</strong> for its powerful organizational features:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}, while others use <strong>Google Docs</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> for their simplicity and collaboration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener">Scrivener</a> – A popular writing app designed for authors, offering a binder to organize scenes and chapters.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> – Free online word processor, great for collaboration and cloud backup.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/word">Microsoft Word</a> – A familiar tool for drafting text, with templates and formatting options.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Editing and Proofreading</h2>
      <p>Once the draft is complete, revising and editing are crucial. Start with self-editing using tools like <strong>Grammarly</strong> or <strong>ProWritingAid</strong> to catch grammar and style issues. After that, consider getting feedback from beta readers or hiring a professional editor for a thorough edit.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. Book Cover Design</h2>
      <p>Your book's cover is the first thing readers see. If you're not a designer, it's wise to get help. You can use DIY tools or hire a professional cover artist. Ensure the cover fits your genre and looks professional – a good cover can greatly impact sales.</p>

      <h2>4. Publishing Platforms</h2>
      <p>After editing and design, it's time to publish. Many indie authors use platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) for e-books and print-on-demand. Other options include IngramSpark or Draft2Digital to distribute to multiple retailers.</p>
